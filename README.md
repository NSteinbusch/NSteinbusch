Hi, I am NSteinbusch. I am a Network Engineer at my Family Business, Cable & Network (www.c-n.be), in Belgium.

I have some certifications :
- Cisco CCENT
- Cisco CCNA
- Ekahau ECSE
- Milestone Xprotect MCDE
- Milestone Xprotect MCIT

I am studying toward my CCNP Enterprise Core for the moment.

I am curious by nature, and I like to build and automate things (related to networking or not). I like also electronics, I build some Arduino labs.

I also like everything related to electrical work, like pulling cables, design electrical circuit, make connections to circuit breakers,...

Have a nice day !
